# Developer Instructions

This document consolidates development guidelines, architectural patterns, and implementation standards for GitHub Agentic Workflows. It provides guidance for contributing to the codebase while maintaining consistency, security, and code quality.

---

## Code Organization Patterns

### Recommended Patterns

The codebase exhibits several well-organized patterns that should be emulated:

#### 1. Create Functions Pattern (`create_*.go`)

**Pattern**: One file per GitHub entity creation operation

**Examples**:
- `create_issue.go` - GitHub issue creation logic
- `create_pull_request.go` - Pull request creation logic
- `create_discussion.go` - Discussion creation logic
- `create_code_scanning_alert.go` - Code scanning alert creation
- `create_agent_task.go` - Agent task creation logic

#### 2. Engine Separation Pattern

**Pattern**: Each AI engine has its own file with shared helpers in `engine_helpers.go`

**Examples**:
- `copilot_engine.go` (971 lines) - GitHub Copilot engine
- `claude_engine.go` (340 lines) - Claude engine
- `codex_engine.go` (639 lines) - Codex engine
- `custom_engine.go` (300 lines) - Custom engine support
- `engine_helpers.go` (424 lines) - Shared engine utilities

#### 3. Test Organization Pattern

**Pattern**: Tests live alongside implementation files with descriptive names

**Examples**:
- Feature tests: `feature.go` + `feature_test.go`
- Integration tests: `feature_integration_test.go`
- Specific scenario tests: `feature_scenario_test.go`

### File Creation Decision Tree

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Need New Functionality?] --> B{Size > 200 lines?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Create New File]
    B -->|No| D{Related to Existing File?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Add to Existing File]
    D -->|No| C
    C --> F{Multiple Related Operations?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Use Create Pattern: create_*.go]
    F -->|No| H[Use Domain Pattern]
    E --> I{File > 1000 lines?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Consider Splitting]
    I -->|No| K[Keep in Same File]
```

### File Size Guidelines

- **Small (50-200 lines)**: Utilities, helpers, simple features
- **Medium (200-500 lines)**: Domain-specific logic, focused features
- **Large (500-1000 lines)**: Complex features, comprehensive implementations
- **Very Large (1000+ lines)**: Consider splitting if not cohesive

## Validation Architecture

The validation system ensures workflow configurations are correct, secure, and compatible with GitHub Actions before compilation. Validation is organized into two main patterns:

1. **Centralized validation** - General-purpose validation in `validation.go`
2. **Domain-specific validation** - Specialized validation in dedicated files

### Validation Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Workflow YAML] --> B[Parser]
    B --> C[Validation System]
    C --> D[Centralized Validation]
    C --> E[Domain-Specific Validation]
    D --> F[validation.go]
    E --> G[strict_mode_validation.go]
    E --> H[pip.go]
    E --> I[npm.go]
    F --> J{Valid?}
    G --> J
    H --> J
    I --> J
    J -->|Yes| K[Compiler]
    J -->|No| L[Error Report]
```

### Centralized Validation: `validation.go`

**Location**: `pkg/workflow/validation.go` (782 lines)

**Purpose**: General-purpose validation that applies across the entire workflow system

**Key Validation Functions**:
- `validateExpressionSizes()` - Ensures GitHub Actions expression size limits
- `validateContainerImages()` - Verifies Docker images exist and are accessible
- `validateRuntimePackages()` - Validates runtime package dependencies
- `validateGitHubActionsSchema()` - Validates against GitHub Actions YAML schema
- `validateNoDuplicateCacheIDs()` - Ensures unique cache identifiers
- `validateSecretReferences()` - Validates secret reference syntax
- `validateRepositoryFeatures()` - Checks repository capabilities (issues, discussions)

### Domain-Specific Validation

#### Strict Mode Validation: `strict_mode_validation.go`

**Purpose**: Enforces security and safety constraints in strict mode

**Validation Functions**:
- `validateStrictMode()` - Main strict mode orchestrator
- `validateStrictPermissions()` - Refuses write permissions
- `validateStrictNetwork()` - Requires explicit network configuration
- `validateStrictMCPNetwork()` - Requires network config on custom MCP servers
- `validateStrictBashTools()` - Refuses bash wildcard tools

#### Package Validation

- **Python/pip**: `pip.go` - Validates Python package availability on PyPI
- **Node.js/npm**: `npm.go` - Validates npm packages used with npx

### Where to Add Validation

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Need Validation?] --> B{Domain-Specific?}
    B -->|Yes| C{Security-Related?}
    B -->|No| D[validation.go]
    C -->|Yes| E[strict_mode_validation.go]
    C -->|No| F{Package Manager?}
    F -->|Python| G[pip.go]
    F -->|Node.js| H[npm.go]
    F -->|Other| I[Create New Domain File]
```
---

## Development Standards

### Capitalization Guidelines

**Rules**:
- **Product Name**: "GitHub Agentic Workflows" (always capitalize)
- **Feature Names**: Use sentence case (e.g., "safe output messages")
- **File Names**: Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `code-organization.md`)
- **Code Elements**: Follow language conventions (e.g., `camelCase` in JavaScript, `snake_case` in Python)
### Breaking Change Rules

**Breaking Changes**:
- Removing or renaming CLI commands, flags, or options
- Changing default behavior that users depend on
- Removing support for configuration formats
- Changing exit codes or error messages that tools parse

**Non-Breaking Changes**:
- Adding new optional flags or commands
- Adding new output formats
- Internal refactoring with same external behavior
- Adding new features that don't affect existing functionality
---

## String Processing

### Sanitize vs Normalize

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Need String Processing?] --> B{Security Concern?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Sanitize]
    B -->|No| D{Consistency Needed?}
    C --> E[sanitizeGitHubLabel]
    C --> F[sanitizeGitHubBranch]
    C --> G[sanitizeGitHubIssueTitle]
    D -->|Yes| H[Normalize]
    D -->|No| I[Use As-Is]
    H --> J[normalizeWhitespace]
    H --> K[normalizeLineEndings]
```

**Sanitize**: Remove or replace characters that could cause security issues or break GitHub API constraints

**Key Functions**:
- `sanitizeGitHubLabel()` - Ensures labels meet GitHub requirements (no emoji, length limits)
- `sanitizeGitHubBranch()` - Validates branch names against Git ref rules
- `sanitizeGitHubIssueTitle()` - Ensures issue titles don't contain problematic characters

**Normalize**: Standardize format for consistency without security implications

**Key Functions**:
- `normalizeWhitespace()` - Standardizes whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines)
- `normalizeLineEndings()` - Converts CRLF to LF
- `normalizeMarkdown()` - Standardizes markdown formatting
---

## YAML Handling

### YAML 1.1 vs 1.2 Gotchas

**Critical Issue**: GitHub Actions uses YAML 1.1, but many Go YAML libraries default to YAML 1.2

**Key Differences**:
- `on` keyword: YAML 1.1 treats as boolean `true`, YAML 1.2 treats as string
- `yes`/`no`: YAML 1.1 treats as booleans, YAML 1.2 treats as strings
- Octal numbers: Different parsing rules

**Solution**: Use `goccy/go-yaml` library which supports YAML 1.1

```go
import "github.com/goccy/go-yaml"

// Correct YAML 1.1 parsing
var workflow map[string]interface{}
err := yaml.Unmarshal(data, &workflow)
```

**Affected Keywords**:
- Workflow triggers: `on`, `push`, `pull_request`
- Boolean values: `yes`, `no`, `true`, `false`, `on`, `off`
- Null values: `null`, `~`
---

## Safe Output Messages

The safe output message system provides structured communication between AI agents and GitHub API operations.

### Message Categories

| Category | Purpose | Footer | Example |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| **Issues** | Create/update issues | With issue number | `> AI generated by [Workflow](url) for #123` |
| **Pull Requests** | Create/update PRs | With PR number | `> AI generated by [Workflow](url) for #456` |
| **Discussions** | Create discussions | With discussion number | `> AI generated by [Workflow](url)` |
| **Comments** | Add comments | Context-aware | `> AI generated by [Workflow](url) for #123` |

### Staged Mode Indicator

The 🎭 emoji consistently marks preview mode across all safe output types, enabling clear distinction between test runs and live operations.

### Message Structure

```yaml
safe_outputs:
  create_issue:
    title: "Issue title"
    body: |
      ## Description

      Content here

      ---
      > AI generated by [WorkflowName](run_url)
```
---

## Custom GitHub Actions

### Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    MD[Workflow .md] --> Compiler
    Compiler --> YAML[.lock.yml]
    YAML --> GHA[GitHub Actions Runner]
    GHA --> Actions[Custom Actions]
    Actions --> API[GitHub API]
```

### Build System

The custom actions build system is **entirely implemented in Go** in `pkg/cli/actions_build_command.go`. There are no JavaScript build scripts.

**Key Commands**:
- `make actions-build` - Build all custom actions
- `make actions-validate` - Validate action configuration
- `make actions-clean` - Clean build artifacts

**Directory Structure**:
```
actions/
└── setup/
    ├── action.yml
    ├── setup.sh
    ├── js/
    └── sh/
```
---

## Security Best Practices

### Template Injection Prevention

**Key Rule**: Never directly interpolate user input into GitHub Actions expressions or shell commands

**Vulnerable Pattern**:
```yaml
# ❌ UNSAFE - User input in expression
- run: echo "Title: ${{ github.event.issue.title }}"
```

**Safe Pattern**:
```yaml
# ✅ SAFE - Use environment variables
- env:
    TITLE: ${{ github.event.issue.title }}
  run: echo "Title: ${TITLE}"
```

### GitHub Actions Security

**Best Practices**:
- Always pin actions to specific commit SHAs, not tags
- Use minimal permissions with `permissions:` block
- Validate all external inputs
- Never log secrets or tokens
- Use GitHub's OIDC for cloud authentication

**Example**:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write

steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@a1b2c3d4... # Pinned SHA
```

## Testing Framework

### Test Strategy

### Test Types

| Test Type | Purpose | Location | Run Frequency |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------------|
| **Unit Tests** | Test individual functions | `*_test.go` | Every commit |
| **Integration Tests** | Test component interactions | `*_integration_test.go` | Pre-merge |
| **Security Regression Tests** | Prevent security issues | `security_regression_test.go` | Every commit |
| **Fuzz Tests** | Find edge cases | `*_fuzz_test.go` | Continuous |
| **Benchmark Tests** | Performance tracking | `*_benchmark_test.go` | Pre-release |

### Visual Regression Testing

Visual regression tests ensure console output formatting remains consistent across code changes. The system uses golden files to capture expected output for table layouts, box rendering, tree structures, and error formatting.

**Golden Test Commands**:
```bash
# Run golden tests
go test -v ./pkg/console -run='^TestGolden_'

# Update golden files (only when intentionally changing output)
make update-golden
```

**Test Coverage**:
- Table rendering with various configurations
- Box formatting with different widths and content
- Tree structures for hierarchical data
- Error messages with context and suggestions
- Message formatting (success, info, warning, error)
- Layout composition and emphasis boxes

**When to Update Golden Files**:
- ✅ Intentionally improving console output formatting
- ✅ Fixing visual bugs in rendering
- ✅ Adding new columns or fields to tables
- ❌ Tests fail unexpectedly during development
- ❌ Making unrelated code changes
---

## Repo-Memory System

The repo-memory feature provides persistent, git-backed storage for AI agents across workflow runs. Agents can maintain state, notes, and artifacts in dedicated git branches with automatic synchronization.

### Architecture Overview

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Agent Job Start] --> B[Clone memory/{id} branch]
    B --> C[Agent reads/writes files]
    C --> D[Upload artifact: repo-memory-{id}]
    D --> E[Push Repo Memory Job]
    E --> F[Download artifact]
    F --> G[Validate files]
    G --> H[Commit to memory/{id}]
    H --> I[Push to repository]
```

### Path Conventions

| Pattern | Format | Example | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|---------|
| **Memory Directory** | `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory/{id}` | `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory/default` | Runtime directory for agent |
| **Artifact Name** | `repo-memory-{id}` | `repo-memory-default` | GitHub Actions artifact |
| **Branch Name** | `memory/{id}` | `memory/default` | Git branch for storage |

### Data Flow

1. **Clone Phase**: Clones `memory/{id}` branch to local directory
2. **Execution Phase**: Agent reads/writes files in memory directory
3. **Upload Phase**: Uploads directory as GitHub Actions artifact
4. **Download Phase**: Downloads artifact and validates constraints
5. **Push Phase**: Commits files to `memory/{id}` branch and pushes

### Key Configuration

```yaml
repo-memory:
  - id: default
    create-orphan: true
    allow-artifacts: true

  - id: orchestration
    create-orphan: true
    max-file-size: 1MB
    max-files: 100
```

**Validation Constraints**:
- Maximum file size limits
- Maximum file count limits
- Allowed/blocked file patterns
- Size and count tracking in commit messages
---

## Hierarchical Agent Management

The hierarchical agent system provides meta-orchestration capabilities to manage multiple agents and workflows at scale. Specialized meta-orchestrator workflows oversee, coordinate, and optimize the agent ecosystem.

### Meta-Orchestrator Architecture

### Meta-Orchestrator Roles

| Role | File | Purpose | Schedule |
|------|------|---------|----------|
| **Workflow Health Manager** | `workflow-health-manager.md` | Monitor workflow health | Daily |
| **Agent Performance Analyzer** | `agent-performance-analyzer.md` | Analyze agent quality | Daily |
---

## Release Management

### Changesets

Use changesets to document changes and manage versioning:

```bash
# Create a changeset
npx changeset

# Release new version
npx changeset version
npx changeset publish
```

**Changeset Format**:
```markdown
---
"gh-aw": patch
---

Brief description of the change
```

**Version Types**:
- **major**: Breaking changes
- **minor**: New features (backward compatible)
- **patch**: Bug fixes and minor improvements

### End-to-End Feature Testing

For manual feature testing in pull requests:

1. Use `.github/workflows/dev.md` as test workflow
2. Add test scenarios as comments in PR
3. Dev Hawk will analyze and verify behavior
4. Do not merge dev.md changes - it remains a reusable test harness
---

## Scope Hints for Complex Workflows

When creating agentic workflows for complex analysis tasks, provide concrete constraints upfront to avoid agent timeouts and vague output. Open-ended prompts force the agent to explore multiple implementation paths, which can exhaust the available time budget.

### General Rule

> The more constraints you provide upfront, the faster and more accurate the generated workflow.

### Workflow-Type Guidance

| Workflow Type | Key Constraints to Specify |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| **File-parsing** | File format (lcov, cobertura, jacoco, etc.) and path |
| **Cross-branch diff** | Branch strategy (base/head names, e.g. `main`/`feature`) |
| **Reporting** | Output format (markdown, JSON, HTML) |
| **Coverage analysis** | Coverage threshold (e.g. 80%), report location |
| **Dependency audit** | Package manager (npm, pip, cargo), severity filter |
| **Performance benchmarks** | Benchmark tool, metric to track, regression threshold |

### Examples

#### ✅ Constrained (faster, more accurate)

```
Create a workflow that reads an lcov coverage report from `coverage/lcov.info`
and comments on PRs if coverage drops below 80%.
```

```
Create a workflow that diffs `main` and the PR head branch, lists changed
Go files, and posts a markdown summary as a PR comment.
```

```
Create a workflow that runs `npm audit --json`, filters results for
high-severity vulnerabilities, and fails the check if any are found.
```

#### ⚠️ Unconstrained (may cause timeout or vague output)

```
Create a workflow that monitors test coverage.
```

```
Create a workflow that checks for dependency vulnerabilities.
```

```
Create a workflow that compares branches and reports differences.
```

### Timeout Prevention Checklist

Before submitting a complex workflow request, confirm you have specified:

- [ ] **Input file path and format** — e.g. `coverage/lcov.info` in lcov format
- [ ] **Triggering event** — e.g. `pull_request`, `push to main`, `schedule`
- [ ] **Success/failure criterion** — e.g. coverage ≥ 80%, zero high-severity CVEs
- [ ] **Output destination** — e.g. PR comment, issue, Slack notification, artifact
- [ ] **Scope boundaries** — e.g. only changed files, only the `src/` directory
---

## PR Deduplication Protocol

Repeated closed PR attempts on the same topic waste CI resources and agent context. Follow this protocol every time you are about to create a pull request.

### Pre-flight Duplicate PR Check

Before opening a PR, search for existing closed PRs with a similar topic using the GitHub MCP `search_pull_requests` tool:

1. Extract 2–4 keywords from the feature/fix title.
2. Run a search such as:
   - `is:pr is:closed head:copilot/ <keywords>`
   - `is:pr is:closed <keywords>`
3. If **no** closed PR is found, proceed normally.
4. If **one or more** closed PRs are found, move to the [Prior Failure Analysis](#prior-failure-analysis) step before writing any code.

### Prior Failure Analysis

When a closed PR exists on the same topic, perform this analysis at the start of the session — before any code exploration or implementation:

1. Read the closed PR description, review comments, and timeline.
2. Identify the **root cause of closure**:
   - Reviewer requested changes → list them explicitly
   - CI/test failures → identify failing checks and root cause
   - Scope mismatch → clarify what was actually requested
   - Duplicate of another fix → link to that fix
3. Verify that the root cause will be addressed in the new implementation.
4. Include a "## Prior Attempts" section in the new PR description that summarizes:
   - Link(s) to prior closed PR(s)
   - Why each was closed
   - What is different this time

**Example PR description section:**

```markdown
## Prior Attempts

- #1234 (closed): CI failed on `TestFoo` due to missing nil check — fixed in this PR
- #1189 (closed): Reviewer requested scope reduction — this PR limits change to X only
```

### Retry Limit Circuit Breaker

If **two or more** closed PRs already exist on the same topic:

1. **Do not open a third PR** without explicit human review.
2. Post a comment on the originating issue that:
   - Lists all prior closed PRs and their close reasons
   - Explains what changed (if anything) in the new approach
   - Requests explicit maintainer approval to proceed
3. Label the issue `copilot-retry-blocked` to signal that human review is required.
4. Wait for a maintainer to remove the label or leave an approving comment before creating the new PR.

**Rationale:** Two consecutive failed PR attempts indicate a systemic problem (unclear requirements, missing context, fundamental design issue) that code changes alone cannot resolve.

### File Locations

| Feature | Implementation File | Test File |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| Validation | `pkg/workflow/validation.go` | `pkg/workflow/validation_test.go` |
| Safe Outputs | `pkg/workflow/safe_outputs.go` | `pkg/workflow/safe_outputs_test.go` |
| String Processing | `pkg/workflow/strings.go` | `pkg/workflow/strings_test.go` |
| Actions Build | `pkg/cli/actions_build_command.go` | `pkg/cli/actions_build_command_test.go` |
| Schema Validation | `pkg/parser/schemas/` | Various test files |

### Common Patterns

**Creating a new GitHub entity handler**:
1. Create `create_<entity>.go` in `pkg/workflow/`
2. Implement `Create<Entity>()` function
3. Add validation in `validation.go` or domain-specific file
4. Create corresponding test file
5. Update safe output messages

**Adding new validation**:
1. Determine if centralized or domain-specific
2. Add validation function in appropriate file
3. Call from main validation orchestrator
4. Add tests for valid and invalid cases
5. Document validation rules

**Adding new engine**:
1. Create `<engine>_engine.go` in `pkg/workflow/`
2. Implement engine interface
3. Use `engine_helpers.go` for shared functionality
4. Add engine-specific tests
5. Register engine in engine factory
